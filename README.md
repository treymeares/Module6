#League Database GUI

Author: Trey Meares

Version: 1.1

Python version: 3.9.5




In this final project, I have created a GUI for a Curling League Database.
This Curling League GUI allows the program user to have many different options in 
managing a league. The functions are as follows:

* Load a League Database
* Save a League Database
* Delete a League Out Of Database
* Add a League To Database
* Edit a League
* Import Team Into League
* Export League Teams to CSV
* Delete Teams from League
* Edit a Particular Team
* Delete a Team Member
* Add A Team Member
* Edit a Team Member

## About The Program

This program is written using Python and utilizes the PyQt5 interface
to create a GUI. Add editors are modal and require input before allowing 
further interaction with the main window. 

To use this program do the following:

1. Launch the Main Window and load or add a league
2. Edit, Delete or save the league.
3. If Editing choose to load a league from a CSV file or add one manually.
4. After adding teams choose to save, edit the team members.
5. If Editing you can choose to add a member, delete a member or update a member.
